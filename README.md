# Extract, Transform, and Load movie data

## Purpose

We were tasked with extracting three sets of data, and cleaning them up before loading them in a PostgreSQL database for use in a hackathon. The process involved going through each set of data to:

  - clear and or fill null values
  
  - remove duplicates
  
  - make the data more concise and or readable
 
Once the three sets of data were cleaned up, they were combined and further cleaned. Once all data sets were ready, they were uploaded to the PostgreSQL database.
